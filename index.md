# Equations in Go

Equations in Go, or eqgo, provides support for mathematical equations in the [Go Programming Language](https://go.dev). Eqgo currently consists of the following repositories:

* [eval](https://github.com/eqgo/eval) which provides mathematical expression evaluation
* [mat](https://github.com/eqgo/mat) which provides an expanded library of math functions
* [cart](https://github.com/eqgo/cart) which provides a generic implementation of the 2D Cartesian Coordinate System
* [types](https://github.com/eqgo/types) which provides basic numerical type constraints
* [solve](https://github.com/eqgo/solve) which is a command line utility to evaluate math expressions
